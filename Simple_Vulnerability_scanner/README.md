# SIMPLE VULNERABILITY SCANNER

This Python script conducts a basic port scan on a specified target IP address, identifying open ports and highlighting potential vulnerabilities associated with them.

## Features

*   Port scanning of a specified target IP address.
*   Basic service detection based on open ports.
*   Rudimentary vulnerability information associated with detected services.
*   Generates a JSON report of the scan results.
*   IP Address validation.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   No external libraries are strictly required for the core functionality.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository (optional):**  If you downloaded the code as a zip or from a repository, extract the files.

2.  **Save the code:** Save the Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `port_scanner.py`).

3.  **Run the script:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script using:

    ```bash
    python port_scanner.py
    ```

4.  **Enter target IP:** The script will prompt you to enter the target IP address.

5.  **View results:** The script will display the open ports found and any potential vulnerabilities.  A JSON report will also be generated in the same directory, named `{target_ip}_scan_report.json`.
